            Welcome to the sorting algorithm visualization game instructions! (gee what a mouthfull that was). 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The game is simple. After studying a series of visualizations and step by step walkthroughs of various sorting algorithms you will then be required to answer a quiz of sorts [ha! get it ;)]. 
            <br/>
            The quiz will include problems where you will have to manually sort different series of numbers according to the selected algorithm. You will be scored by the amount of mistakes you make when sorting the values as well as how long it takes you to sort them.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            High scores will be recorded for all to see, so study hard and do your best!
